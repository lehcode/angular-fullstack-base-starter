# Building Scalable and Maintainable Applications with a Monorepo Approach

The ultimate guide for building a full-stack web application using NestJS, Yarn workspaces, and NX! In this guide, you will learn how to set up initial folder structure of your project, manage dependencies with Yarn workspaces, and utilize version control with NX. We will also cover how to add NestJS as an API service, serve client requests.

But that's not all! We will dive even deeper into creating shared libraries, adding Angular application as an admin frontend. Lastly, we'll generalize all configurations using docker-compose.yml.

This guide is perfect for developers looking to build a scalable and efficient full-stack web application using the latest technologies. Let's get started!

The guide covers:
 - Initial setup and directory structure
 - Dependency management with Yarn workspaces
 - Versioning control with NX
 - Adding NestJS as an API service
 - Serving client requests under /input API endpoint prefix 
 - Creating shared libraries for all repositories using a shared monorepo package 
 - Creating common libraries for the API using a common-be monorepo package 
 - Creating common libraries for the admin frontend using a common-fe monorepo package 
 - Adding an Angular application as an admin frontend to the NestJS service under the monorepo 
 - Generalizing all configurations using docker-compose.yml

Before getting started, ensure that you have:
 - Docker installed
 - Basic knowledge of Docker, Node.js, and Yarn

Follow the detailed steps in the guide to build a scalable and maintainable application with a monorepo approach.
